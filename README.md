<h1 align="center" id="title">URL Shortener</h1>

<p id="description">URL shortening is a technique in which a Uniform Resource Locator may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL</p>


‚óè	Developed a Golang application to parse and convert original URLs to a short URL. <br>
‚óè	Implemented SQLite database to optimize accessing speeds, enhancing the overall user experience.
